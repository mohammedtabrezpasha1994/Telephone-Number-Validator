# Telephone-Number-Validator
The Telephone Number Validator is a certification Project from JavaScript Learnings in www.freecodecamp.org. You may fill out the form field any way you choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number. It returns true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.
